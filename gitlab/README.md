## Prerequisites

Ensure that Docker is installed on your host system. Follow the official installation guide at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Create Docker Volumes

```bash
docker volume create gitlab-config
docker volume create gitlab-data
docker volume create gitlab-logs
```

These volumes will store GitLab's configuration, data files (repositories), and logs respectively.

### Step 2: Pull the GitLab CE Image

Run this command to fetch the latest official GitLab CE image:

```bash
docker pull gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
```

### Step 3: Run the Docker Container

Execute the following command to start a Docker container for GitLab CE, linking it with the volumes created earlier and mapping ports:

```bash
docker run --detach \
    --hostname=your-gitlab-hostname.example.com \
    --publish 80:80 --publish 443:443 --publish 22:22 \
    --restart always \
    --name gitlab-ce \
    -v gitlab-config:/etc/gitlab \
    -v gitlab-data:/var/opt/gitlab \
    -v gitlab-logs:/var/log/gitlab \
    gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
```

## Accessing the GitLab Instance

Visit `http://your-gitlab-hostname.example.com` in your web browser to access the GitLab UI.

### Set Admin Password

During your first login attempt, set an administrator password for user "root" following on-screen instructions.

## Customizing Configuration

Modify configuration settings through the admin panel or by editing files within `/etc/gitlab/` directory using a volume mapping technique. Remember to restart the container for changes to take effect:

```bash
docker restart gitlab-ce
```

## Maintaining Your Installation

Regularly update GitLab CE and Docker images with security patches released periodically.

### Updating Docker Image

Pull the latest image version from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
```

Replace your existing container with a new one based on this updated image:

```bash
docker stop gitlab-ce && docker rm gitlab-ce
docker run --name gitlab-ce [...command arguments...]
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the GitLab instance fails to start or behaves unexpectedly, check logs inside the `gitlab-logs` volume.
- Ensure network connectivity and that required ports are not blocked by firewall rules.

For further assistance with configuration issues, refer to official Docker documentation for GitLab CE at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/docker.html or search relevant forums and community discussions online.
